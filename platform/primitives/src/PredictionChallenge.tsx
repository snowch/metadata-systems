// Predict, commit, see, predict again: the controls every
// prediction figure shares. The learner picks one option and commits to it before anything is
// shown, then may pick another and commit again: these are hypothesis tests, not quizzes, and
// changing one's answer is a normal investigative action, not an error. What is
// predicted, and how its answer is worked out and drawn, stays with the figure: the choice is a
// string, and the verdict and the outcome are the figure's to show.
